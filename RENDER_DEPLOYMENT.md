## 🎯 **Choose Your Deployment:**

### Option A: Render (Easiest, but slower)
### Option B: Railway (Faster, modern)
### Option C: Both (Redundancy)

## Option A: Deploy to Render

### Step 1: Push Backend to GitHub

### 1.1 Create a new repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" 
3. Name it: `data-cleaner-backend`
4. Keep it public
5. Don't add README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 1.2 Connect your local code to GitHub
# Run these commands in your terminal (backend folder):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/data-cleaner-backend.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

## Step 2: Deploy to Render

### 2.1 Go to Render
1. Visit https://render.com
2. Sign up with GitHub (free)
3. Click "New +"
4. Select "Web Service"

### 2.2 Connect Repository
1. Connect your GitHub account
2. Select your `data-cleaner-backend` repository
3. Click "Connect"

### 2.3 Configure Deployment
Fill in these settings:
- **Name**: `data-cleaner-api`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Runtime**: `Python 3`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements-prod.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main_prod:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`

### 2.4 Deploy
1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment
3. Your API will be live at: `https://data-cleaner-api.onrender.com`

## Step 3: Test Your API
Visit: https://data-cleaner-api.onrender.com/health

## Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Netlify
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag and drop your frontend folder
3. Set environment variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://data-cleaner-api.onrender.com`

## Option B: Deploy to Railway (Faster Alternative)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
# In your backend folder:
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Step 3: Your API will be live at:
`https://your-project.railway.app`

---

## Option C: Deploy to Both (Recommended)

1. **Deploy to Render** (primary)
2. **Deploy to Railway** (backup)
3. **Frontend can switch between them**

---

## 🚀 **My Recommendation:**

### **For Learning/Testing:** Use Render
- Accept the 50-second delay
- It's completely free forever
- Perfect for portfolio projects

### **For Better Performance:** Use Railway  
- Faster cold starts
- Better user experience
- Still free (500 hours/month)

### **For Production:** Consider paid hosting
- Heroku ($7/month)
- DigitalOcean ($5/month)
- AWS/Google Cloud

## 🎯 Quick Summary:
1. Push backend to GitHub ✅
2. Deploy to Render ✅ 
3. Deploy frontend to Netlify ✅
4. Connect them together ✅

This is completely free and much easier than Heroku!
